# SoftServe-DS-Hackathon-2020

In this (Kaggle competition)[https://www.kaggle.com/c/softserve-ds-hackathon-2020] I visualized employee history dataset and built some inferences. 
The major goal of the competition - develop a model, which provides an answer to the question - "Will the particular Employee leave the Company within the next three months?". 
I answered on it by using Logistic Regression on aggregated features of time series data.
